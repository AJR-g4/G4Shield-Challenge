# 🧠 G⁴ Shield Encryption Challenge

Welcome to the first-ever file encrypted using **G⁴ Shield** — a topological encryption engine based on 4D group morphism generation.

## 🔐 The Challenge

Enclosed in this repo is an encrypted file:

📁 `decryptme.g4e`

It was generated using a **custom morphism encryption system**, not based on AES or any known symmetric cipher. The transformation logic uses 4D topological constructs and irrational number mapping — designed to be unbreakable without both the password and the tool.

Your goal:
- Decrypt the file
- Read the plaintext inside
- Send me the **exact message** as proof

## 💡 Hints

- No known algorithms or brute-force tools will help you unless you can reverse the topological logic.
- The encrypted file includes an HMAC for validation.
- The morphism key is deterministically derived from the password using irrational-based mapping.

## 📬 Submit Your Solution

If you decrypt the file, send the full contents to:

No prize. Just bragging rights and respect.
